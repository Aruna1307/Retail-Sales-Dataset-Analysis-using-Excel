# Retail Sales Data Analysis 📊💼

Welcome to the Retail Sales Data Analysis project! 
In this project, I worked with a retail sales dataset and performed various analyses using **Excel** to extract valuable insights. The goal was to analyze sales data, calculate commissions, and summarize key metrics to support decision-making in retail operations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Excel Functions**:
  - `SUM`: Calculating total sales and other important sums.
  - `AVERAGE`: Analyzing average sales data.
  - `UNIQUE`: Extracting unique values from datasets.
  - `VLOOKUP`: Lookup values to find relevant data.
  - `SUMIF` and `SUMIFS`: Conditional summing based on specified criteria.
  - **Cell Referencing**: Ensuring formulas update dynamically.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Pivot Tables**: Creating pivot tables to summarize sales by different categories.
  - **Pivot Charts**: Visualizing data trends and patterns.
  - **Slicers**: Adding interactive filtering capabilities to pivot tables for better exploration of data.

## 📈 Key Insights & Calculations:
- **Commission Calculation**: I created a column that calculates commission based on sales.
- **Total Sales**: A column was created to calculate the total sales per transaction.
